# Data and code needed for reproducing results of "Henn et al. Metabolomic and morphological trait diversity display contrasting patterns in temperate forest tree communities" published in Ecosphere.

Scripts:
Script 1, "null_model_fitting" has the code needed to reproduce the null models of functional dispersion and any statistics mentioned in the manuscript. However, intermediate outputs of all the bootstrapping are also saved in the "outputs" folder, which can then be called for creating figures and rerunning the statistics.

Script 2, "site_env_pcas" includes all the code necessary for reproducing figure 2 of the manuscript.

Script 3, "plots" has code for producing all the other plots included in the manuscript.

Data:
All raw data are included in the data folder.

Output:
This folder contains intermediate outputs like cleaned and compiled species composition and traits, null model bootstrap outputs, etc.
